\title{pflamelet: Persistence Flamelets}
\description{
Computes the Persistence Flamelets, a statistical tool for exploring the
Topological Invariants of Scale-Space families introduced in Padellini and Brutti (2017)
"Persistence Flamelets: multiscale Persistent Homology for kernel density exploration" <arXiv:1709.07097>.Flamelets can be built from either sub/super level sets of arbitrary functions or
from a precomputed list of Persistence Diagrams.
In addition, this package provides functions to compute confidence bands for a Flamelet via bootstrap, assess significance of each feature,
clean a Flamelet from topological noise, perform a two sample permutation test for groups of Flamelets and it also implements a topological heuristic for bandwidth selection for kernel density estimators.
