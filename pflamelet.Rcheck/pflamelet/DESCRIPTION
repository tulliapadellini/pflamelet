Title: Persistence Flamelets: Computation and Inferential Tools
Version: 0.1.1
Author: Tullia Padellini
Maintainer: Tullia Padellini <t.padellini@imperial.ac.uk>
Description: Computes the Persistence Flamelets, a statistical tool for exploring the Topological Invariants of Scale-Space families introduced in Padellini and Brutti (2017) "Persistence Flamelets: multiscale Persistent Homology for kernel density exploration" <arXiv:1709.07097>.
    Flamelets can be built from either sub/super level sets of arbitrary functions or
    from a precomputed list of Persistence Diagrams. 
    In addition, this package provides functions to compute confidence bands for a Flamelet via bootstrap, assess significance of each feature, 
    clean a Flamelet from topological noise, perform a two sample permutation test for groups of Flamelets and it also implements a topological heuristic for bandwidth selection for kernel density estimators.
